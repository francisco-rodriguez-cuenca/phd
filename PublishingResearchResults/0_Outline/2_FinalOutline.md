# Outline - Closer Control of Loops with Dead Time

## Three central points of the paper

* It is difficult to stabilize process control loops that contain large amounts of dead-time.
* This novel method enables high accuracy in loops with high dead-time by reducing the time to recover from an upset to approximately the value of the system dead-time.
* It is theoretically impossible to reduce the correction time further.

## Summarize the paper in one sentence

The proposal of a novel method of obtaining high accuracy in a process control by using a minor feedback loop around the controller to prevent dead-time-excited oscillations.

## Try to describe the work in under one minute

Lots of systems have large amounts of dead-time, such as catalytic crackers (1) or cold rolling mills (2,3). Since conventional methods are very difficult to use in this context, we need a new method for stabilizing process control loops that contain large amounts of dead-time. 

In this paper we propose a minor feedback loop around the controller to prevent dead-timed-excited oscillations. This loop generates the difference between the system output without dead-time and the system output with dead time and, when introduced in negative feedback to the input of the controller, it allows the permissible gain to be adjusted a very high value, stabilizing the system. This reduces the time to recover from an upset to its theoretical limit: the value of the system dead-time.
  
The method can be applied at any system with high dead-time, enabling in this context process control with high accuracy.
