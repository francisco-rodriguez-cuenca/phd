# Introduction correction

## Intro to correct

1. __Establishing the topic area__ -> weak / empty

The conversion of AC to DC power by electronic converters introduces various issues affecting power quality. These issues include harmonic distortions, voltage fluctuations, poor power factor, voltage imbalances, electromagnetic interference, and resonance problems. These power quality problems occur at the "point of common coupling" (PCC), where multiple electrical circuits connect, ultimately leading to a lower-quality power supply for end consumers and potential disruptions for their electrical equipment.

This can be compensated by using the filters at the front end of AC/DC converter. However, filters are very effectively meet the power quality requirements but these are not an economical solution.[1] The alternative solution to above problem is inherent modification in converter (improved power quality converters or HPFC) to meet power quality features[2]. Since last one decade three phase multi-level HPF converters HB[3], FCC[4], DCC[5] are very extensively used in medium voltage and high power applications such as variable ‚Äìspeed control of AC drives[6], HVDC transmission, FACTS [7], static VAR compensation[8], battery storage systems etc.

4. __Occupying the niche__

In this paper special focus on MPC structured converters, specially 5-level Diode Clamped Converter(DCC). However, this 5LDCC shows well satisfactory operation with reactive power transfer application, but having inherent capacitor voltage balancing problem, when it is used for active power transfer applications, especially at high modulation index with UPF operation between utility and DC link capacitors. The relation m=3/ùúã‚ãÖcosùõ∑ where m is modulation index and ùõ∑  is load power angle shows stable boundary for modulation index versus load power factor angle[9‚Äì12].
